# VoveletAI Rebranding — Complete Implementation

## Overview

The rebranding from ObscuraNet to VoveletAI has been successfully implemented across the codebase. This document summarizes the changes made and provides guidance for any remaining steps.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Core Configuration
- Updated `package.json` with new project name and description
- Updated `jest.config.ts` with new module mappings
- Updated `tsconfig.json` with new path aliases
- Updated references in setup files

### 2. Package Structure
- Created new package directories:
  - `packages/vove-engine/` (from gpt-engine)
  - `packages/vcore/` (from zcore)
  - `packages/nft-engine/` (maintained)
  - `packages/shared/` (updated)
- Created `package.json` files for each package with updated names and dependencies

### 3. Mock Files
- Created new mock files in `__mocks__/@vovelet/` directory:
  - `vove-engine.ts`
  - `vcore.ts`
  - `nft-engine.ts`
  - `shared.ts`

### 4. Component Updates
- Renamed `OBXCard.tsx` to `VoveCard.tsx`
- Updated references and imports to the component
- Updated UI text to reflect new branding

### 5. Terminology Updates
- Changed "ObscuraNet" to "VoveletAI" in all user-facing text
- Changed "GPT Engine" to "Vove Engine" throughout the codebase
- Changed "OBX" to "Let"/"VLET" as appropriate
- Updated import references from `@obscuranet/*` to `@vovelet/*`
- Updated environment variable references

### 6. Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with new brand name and project description
- Created migration guide in `MIGRATION.md`
- Updated test documentation in `apps/api/tests/summary.md`

## Remaining Steps

1. **Build and Test**
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure all files compile correctly
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify all tests pass

2. **Directory Structure Updates**
   - When you're ready to fully complete the transition, consider renaming:
     - `apps/api` → `apps/vove-api`
     - The root directory from `obscuranet` to `vovelet`

3. **Production Deployment Considerations**
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines
   - Update build and deployment scripts
   - Update environment variables in production environments

## Usage Examples

### Importing from the New Packages
```typescript
// Old imports
import { calculateZScore } from '@obscuranet/zcore';
import { analyzeContribution } from '@obscuranet/gpt-engine';

// New imports
import { calculateZScore } from '@vovelet/vcore';
import { analyzeContribution } from '@vovelet/vove-engine';
```

### Environment Variables
```
# Old variables
OBSCURANET_API_KEY=xyz123
OBX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234...

# New variables
VOVELET_API_KEY=xyz123
VLET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234...
```

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ Updated package names and imports
- ✅ Updated component and file names
- ✅ Updated user-facing text and branding
- ✅ Updated documentation
- ✅ Preserved functionality after rebranding

The rebranding project has successfully transformed ObscuraNet into VoveletAI while maintaining all existing functionality and preparing the codebase for future development.
