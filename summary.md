# Jest with TypeScript Setup for ObscuraNet

## Summary of Work Completed

1. **Set up Jest with TypeScript**
   - Created jest.config.ts with TypeScript configuration and module mapping
   - Set up mock implementations for internal ObscuraNet packages
   - Added proper TypeScript support for tests

2. **Created Mock Implementations for Internal Packages**
   - @obscuranet/gpt-engine
   - @obscuranet/nft-engine
   - @obscuranet/zcore
   - @obscuranet/shared

3. **Enhanced Firebase Admin Mocking**
   - Created sophisticated mock for firebase-admin with proper initialization
   - Implemented solution for the apps.length issue that was causing test failures
   - Developed in-memory Firestore mock with collection/document handling
   - Added enhanced FieldValue mock with server timestamp, increment, array union/remove
   - Implemented Auth mock with user management
   - Created Storage mock for file operations
   - Added testing helper methods for resetting and inspecting state

4. **Implemented Firebase Functions Testing**
   - Enhanced firebase-functions mock with comprehensive triggers
   - Created improved firebase-functions-test that works with the API tests
   - Improved handling of Cloud Functions context objects
   - Fixed functionsTest.wrap() to make it work with the existing tests

5. **Fixed API Tests Infrastructure**
   - Updated API test setup to provide proper test context
   - Added helpers for cleanup and error handling
   - Fixed handling of FieldValue in API tests
   - Added error creation utilities for consistent testing

6. **Blockchain Event Listener Script**
   - Created a script to listen for Transfer events from NFT contracts
   - Used ethers.js v6 syntax

7. **Setup Jest Initialization**
   - Created jest.setup.ts file for global test setup
   - Added mocks for firebase-admin, firebase-functions, and ethers.js

## Current Status

- All basic tests are passing, including:
  - Basic mock tests (GPT engine, NFT engine, Zcore)
  - Mock integration tests
  - Firebase Admin mock tests

- API tests infrastructure has been fixed to properly handle:
  - functionsTest.wrap() usage
  - Context objects with auth property
  - FieldValue operations
  - Clean up after tests

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Firebase Admin Mock

- **Firestore**: In-memory implementation with collection/document structure
- **FieldValue**: Special objects for server timestamp, increment, array operations
- **Auth**: User management with custom claims
- **Storage**: File operations with bucket/file structure
- **Apps**: Properly initialized apps array to prevent apps.length errors

### Firebase Functions Test Mock

- **Cloud Function Wrapping**: Enhanced wrap function that correctly handles both direct functions and objects with handlers
- **Context Handling**: Automatic creation of context objects with auth property
- **Error Helpers**: Utilities for creating and testing HttpsError objects
- **Firestore Testing**: Document snapshots and change objects for Firestore triggers

### Mock Implementation Structure

1. **Global Mocks** (in jest.setup.ts):
   - Provide default implementations for all Firebase services
   - Fix apps.length issue that was breaking tests
   - Support for all Cloud Functions trigger types

2. **Local Mocks** (in apps/api/tests/setup.ts):
   - Specialized mocks for API tests
   - Custom functionsTest implementation
   - In-memory collection storage for test data
   - Cleanup utilities

These enhancements allow tests to properly simulate the Firebase environment without actual Firebase connections.
